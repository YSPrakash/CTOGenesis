This
 architecture diagram depicts a typical AWS deployment with a web tier, application tier, and
 database tier. 

**Web Tier**

* The web tier utilizes an
 auto-scaling group behind a public-facing load balancer. 
* This allows for high availability and scalability of the web application. 
* Traffic is
 routed through a NAT gateway to provide secure access to internal resources. 
* The bastion host acts as a jump-box for administrators to manage instances.


**Application Tier**

* The application tier is also based on an auto-scaling group and a load balancer. 
* This tier is responsible for processing the application logic. 
* It is separated from the web tier for security
 and scalability purposes.

**Database Tier**

* The database tier is a single RDS instance within its own private subnet. 
* This tier is responsible for storing application data.

**Security and Management**

* The security groups
 associated with each instance restrict incoming and outgoing traffic, ensuring a secure environment. 
* This architecture follows the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary access to each resource.

**Key Takeaways**

* This architecture emphasizes separation of concerns by dividing the application into tiers.
* It leverages AWS services like auto
-scaling groups and load balancers for high availability and scalability.
* Security best practices are employed through the use of security groups and private subnets.
* The architecture is flexible and can be easily scaled up or down based on application requirements.
